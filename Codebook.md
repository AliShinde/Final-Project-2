The script follows five steps to the give the output of tidySet 
Step 1: Reading files from the zip file
Step 2: Merging the datasets
Step 3: Extracting measurements on mean and standard deviation of each measurement
Step 4: Using activity names 
Step 5: Creating a second inependent tidy set as the output dataset

About variables:-
x_train, y_train and sub_train are the training set varaibales
x_test, y_test and sub_test are the test set variables
final is the dataset containg the merged dataset 
final_mean_std is the dataset containing the mean and standard deviation of each measurement
tidySet is the final output dataset
